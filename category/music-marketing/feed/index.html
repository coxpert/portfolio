<p>Digital distribution services make it easier and cheaper than ever before. They can shrink your time and financial investment. Each distribution service has its pros and cons. Many are simple but make details hard to control. Some make mistakes.</p>
<h2>iTunes, Spotify, Amazon, Google Play</h2>
<p>Radio and YouTube promotion also go hand in hand, as well as digital advertising on the Google and Facebook ecosystem (something we do) to promote your brand and releases.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Set up smartURL with Facebook pixel and Google AdWords</h2>
<p>Look for the Company Dashboard in smartURL. A link is most likely at the top of the page when you log in, if you don&#8217;t land on it automatically. In order to retarget your visitors and potential customers, you need to add the Facebook pixel and / or Google AdWords retargeting IDs to your smartURL.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-375 size-large" src="https://upgrademedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Screen-Shot-2018-03-30-at-3.16.58-PM-1024x91.png" alt="SmartURL Header" width="1024" height="91" srcset="https://upgrademedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Screen-Shot-2018-03-30-at-3.16.58-PM-1024x91.png 1024w, https://upgrademedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Screen-Shot-2018-03-30-at-3.16.58-PM-300x27.png 300w, https://upgrademedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Screen-Shot-2018-03-30-at-3.16.58-PM-768x68.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>Once logged in you an click on the Company Dashboard link and look for the analytics and Facebook account connection tool.</p>
<p>It will ask you to connect an account.</p>
<h2>Set up a Facebook pixel for retargeting on your smartURL</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-376 size-large" src="https://upgrademedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Screen-Shot-2018-03-30-at-3.22.01-PM-1024x639.png" alt="Connect ad account" width="1024" height="639" srcset="https://upgrademedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Screen-Shot-2018-03-30-at-3.22.01-PM-1024x639.png 1024w, https://upgrademedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Screen-Shot-2018-03-30-at-3.22.01-PM-300x187.png 300w, https://upgrademedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Screen-Shot-2018-03-30-at-3.22.01-PM-768x479.png 768w, https://upgrademedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Screen-Shot-2018-03-30-at-3.22.01-PM.png 1760w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>Notice you will add an Account Name, Account ID, and Conversion ID.</p>
<p>All you need is an &#8220;Account Name&#8221; which is whatever you want to call it (so you can easily find it in the UX), the Account ID (that&#8217;s the number from Facebook in this case), and Pixel ID (the pixel number provided you by Facebook).</p>
<p>Your ad agency should provide those to you or you can create them yourself in Facebook&#8217;s Business Manager and Google Analytics.</p>
<p>When you add the details in these fields, and click the + button, you should be able to associate this remarketing / retargeting pixel or conversion tracking to a given SmartURL landing page.</p>
<p>Go to the SmartURL you want to track, by choosing it among your active SmartURLs, and scroll down to retargeting.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-377 size-large" src="https://upgrademedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/smartURL-facebook-pixel-1024x457.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="457" srcset="https://upgrademedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/smartURL-facebook-pixel-1024x457.jpg 1024w, https://upgrademedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/smartURL-facebook-pixel-300x134.jpg 300w, https://upgrademedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/smartURL-facebook-pixel-768x343.jpg 768w, https://upgrademedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/smartURL-facebook-pixel.jpg 1896w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>Since you added the account, the name you provided that account should show up in the &#8220;Choose an Option&#8221; drop down menu.</p>
<p>You can enter Facebook pixels and Google tracking IDs.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;ve entered your Facebook pixel correctly, you can test the Facebook pixel to see if it works on that smartURL page. If you are working with an agency, they can see this in Facebook Business Manager.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-382 size-large" src="https://upgrademedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/smartURL_Facebook_Pixel_Works-1024x389.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="389" srcset="https://upgrademedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/smartURL_Facebook_Pixel_Works-1024x389.jpg 1024w, https://upgrademedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/smartURL_Facebook_Pixel_Works-300x114.jpg 300w, https://upgrademedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/smartURL_Facebook_Pixel_Works-768x292.jpg 768w, https://upgrademedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/smartURL_Facebook_Pixel_Works.jpg 1248w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>Once you&#8217;ve added the Facebook pixel and Google tracking code, you&#8217;ve done the important first steps in better tracking conversions. Now you have the option of further tweaking your campaign to maximize ad spend.</p>
<h3>smartURL offers a smartURL action to further track actions on the smartURL page</h3>
