The rule in Europe right now is that any time you identify someone as a prospect and collect connecting data on them, you have to explicitly warn them that you are doing that. And, you must provide them a clear and obvious way to opt out.<\/p>\n<p>Fear not. There are ways to send eyeballs to your offers with GDPR warning statements, if you provide them.<\/p>\n<p>Marketers are still free to use the embedded pixel without explicit warning in the US.<\/p>\n<p>Twitter is full of brands that use news links to maintain attention. The brand with the best curated news for a niche topic can maintain substantial attention. Obviously, blogs and podcasts produce better stickiness. But, for the rapid fire cycle of attention maintenance, links can be very effective.<\/p>\n<p>Branded links to sticky content are even simpler and faster. It takes very little human effort to identify content as potentially interesting to your target audience. Automation can be implemented to grab topics automatically from newsfeeds and regurgitate them with branded links.<\/p>\n<p>The next question is whether to use a pixel to push ads to that target audience member or immediately offer a CTA.<\/p>\n<p>These services provide pre-built systems to plug in your offers or pixels to track or sell your target audience when they click on your link.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Clicking links can reveal someone as a prospect or potential target audience.
